# hello-tech

My name is Elson and I am new here. I actually signed up for the HNG internship 7.0 and I will be working on tasks here and there. So I would probably come here to make new commits to this repo.

# a-short-bio

I am a procurement professional who wants to move completely into tech. I love creativity and I just like to see things created. I write poems, and just generally pen down thoughts as the come to me.

# cheers!
